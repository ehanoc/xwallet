<h1>Create Wallet</h1>
A wallet can be created in a number of ways:
<ul>
    <li>New Address</li>
    <li>Recover from Seed</li>
    <li>Recover from Keys</li>
    <li>View Only</li>
</ul>
In all cases you need to name your wallet and give it a password. The password is used for
securing your wallet data on the device. Use a strong password - even better use a passphrase.

<h2>New Address</h2>
You need a new Monero Address - no need to enter any additional info.
<h3>Take Note of your Mnemonic Seed!</h3>
<p>
    On the following screen you will find your 25-word "Mnemonic Seed".
    This is the only data needed to recover your wallet at a later point
    and gain full access to your funds.
    Keeping this secure and private is very important, as it gives <em>anyone</em>
    full access to your funds!
</p>
<p>
    If you lose your wallet password, you can still recover your wallet with the Mnemonic Seed.
</p>
<p>
    There is no way to recover your Mnemonic Seed, if you lose it all your funds will be lost!
    The Mnemonic Seed can also never be changed, and if it is stolen or otherwise compromised,
    you will have to move your funds to new wallet (with a new Mnemonic Seed). Therefore, it is best
    that you backup your Mnemonic Seed by writing it down and storing it in <em>multiple</em> safe
    and secure places.
</p>
<h2>Recover from Seed</h2>
If you already have a Monero Address and want to recover the transactions from the blockchain.<br/>
Enter your Seed in the field "Mnemonic Seed". If you know the block number of the first
transaction used for this address, enter it in the field "Restore Height" - leaving it blank will
scan the <em>entire</em> blockchain for transactions belonging to your address.
This takes a <em>long</em> time.

<h2>Recover from Keys</h2>
Instead of recovering from the Mnemonic Seed, you can recover using your keys.<br/>
Enter your Monero Address in the field "Public Address" and fill out "View Key", "Spend Key"
and optionally "Restore Height" with the appropriate values.

<h2>View Only</h2>
If you just want to monitor incoming transactions to a wallet.<br/>
Enter your Monero Address in the field "Public Address" and fill out the "View Key" and
optionally "Restore Height" with the appropriate values leaving the "Spend Key" blank.
