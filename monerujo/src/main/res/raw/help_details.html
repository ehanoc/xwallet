<h1>Wallet Details</h1>
Here you see the details of your wallet.
<ul>
    <li>Mnemonic Seed</li>
    <li>Public Address</li>
    <li>View Key</li>
    <li>Spend Key</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mnemonic Seed</h2>
<p>
    Your 25-word "Mnemonic Seed". This is the only data needed to recover your wallet at a later
    point and gain full access to your funds.
    Keeping this secure and private is very important, as it gives <em>anyone</em>
    full access to your funds!
</p>
<p>
    If you lose your wallet password, you can still recover your wallet with the Mnemonic Seed.
</p>
<p>
    There is no way to recover your Mnemonic Seed, if you lose it all your funds will be lost!
    The Mnemonic Seed can also never be changed, and if it is stolen or otherwise compromised,
    you will have to move your funds to new wallet (with a new Mnemonic Seed). Therefore, it is best
    that you backup your Mnemonic Seed by writing it down and storing it in <em>multiple</em> safe
    and secure places.
</p>

more than this address to send you Monero.
